# A tutorial on how to get glsl shaders downloaded from shaderfrog.com to work in bevy

These shaders are written for the three.js library and do as such not work without modification in bevy.
All GLSL shaders are in the assets/shaders folder

# What can I lean?
Shaders will be availbable in both a three.js version (which are not working in bevy) and a modified version that works in bevy..that way you can see for yourself what to do convert other shaderfrog shaders. Comments are included that explains the process.

* Disclaimer: I'm still working in this little project, everything is not working yet.
## How to run
```
cargo run --example (pick an example from the examples folder)
```
